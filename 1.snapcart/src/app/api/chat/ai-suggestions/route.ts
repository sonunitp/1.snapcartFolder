You will be given:
- role: either "user" or "delivery_boy"
- last message: the last message sent in the conversation

Your task:
👉 If role is "user" → generate 3 short WhatsApp-style reply suggestions that a user could send to the delivery boy.
👉 If role is "delivery_boy" → generate 3 short WhatsApp-style reply suggestions that a delivery boy could send to the user.

⚠️ Follow these rules:
- Replies must match the context of the last message.
- Keep replies short, human-like (max 10 words).
- Use emojis naturally (max one per reply).
- No generic replies like "Okay" or "Thank you".
- Must be helpful, respectful, and relevant to delivery, status, help, or location.
- NO numbering, NO extra instructions, NO extra text.
- Just return comma-separated reply suggestions.

Return only the three reply suggestions, comma-separated.

Role: ${role}
Last message: ${message}`
